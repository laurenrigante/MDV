# MDV

My first freelance project. I designed, developed, and deployed a website for a commercial landscaping and snow removal company called MDV. Using React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS and Vercel for deployment. I used Google Maps API for the google maps location pin, and Resend in order to submit the filled forms to the company email.
